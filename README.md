## Code Overview
The main component of the application is UserTable, defined in the UserTable.js file. It fetches user data from the API, renders the table header and rows based on the fetched data, and provides a basic search functionality.

The component uses React hooks (useState and useEffect) to manage state and perform side effects. The useState hook is used to store the user data, and the useEffect hook is used to fetch the data from the API when the component mounts.

The renderTableHeader function renders the table header with column names.

The renderTableRows function maps over the user data and renders the table rows with user information.

## Customization
You can customize the application according to your needs:

Modify the API endpoint in the fetchUsers function to fetch data from a different source.
Adjust the table headers and row rendering in the renderTableHeader and renderTableRows functions to display additional or different user information.
Implement additional search and filtering functionality to enhance the application.
